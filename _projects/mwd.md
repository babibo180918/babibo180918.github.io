Mask Wearing Detection (MWD) is an application that try to detect human face wearing mask or not. The project is implemented for learning purpose at the time Covid-19 pandemic has been seriously destroying the world in all aspects. I hope this work would encourage people around the world putting more effort on how to prevent this disaster.

The application is implemented by using different Neural Networks models from low to high level to come up with a good MWD detector.
There will be models that use BBBLearning tools that implemented NNs algorithms for learning purpose.
All data used to train these models is from Real-World Masked Face Datasetï¼Œ[RMFD](https://github.com/X-zhangyang/Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset).
Thanks to [Zhongyuan Wang](https://github.com/X-zhangyang) and team for collecting and sharing the data.
