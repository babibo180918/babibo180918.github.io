I have finished my PhD (September 2024) at the [center for Ear-EEG](https://ece.au.dk/en/research/research-centres/center-for-ear-eeg/), Aarhus university, under the co-supervision of Prof. [Preben Kidmose](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/preben-kidmose(97746ef8-ce87-40f8-9a00-85dac54eb276).html), Prof. [Kaare Mikkelsen](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/kaare-mikkelsen(08cd3da7-c501-49c6-a51d-25c2fb0e95e4).html) and Dr. [Huy Phan](https://pquochuy.github.io/) (Queen Mary University of London/Amazon, AGI). I am now a postdoctoral researcher at Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aarhus University.
<br/>

I received the B.Eng degree from the Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (Vietnam) and M.Eng degree from Kyung Hee University (South Korea) in 2010 and 2012, respectively.
<br/>

From 2012 to 2020, I have gained professional experience in industry by working on various projects: video, audio fingerprints, audio signal processing solution for Samsung smartphones.
<br/>

My research interests are auditory attention decoding, EEG signal processing, machine learning/deep learning and joint audio-bio signal analysis. You can find my CV [here](/files/CV_NhanNguyen_latest.pdf).
